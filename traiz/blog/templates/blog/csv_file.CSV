Kubota Invests in U.S. Based Agriculture Technology Start-up;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.kubota.com/news/2020/20200109.html;2020-01-09;Kubota Corporation announced that it has invested in Abundant Robotics, a U.S. based start-up offering robotics-based automation in agriculture. After Kubota launched its Innovation Center in June 2019 as a division for the pursuit of open innovation based on coordination with external partners, the company has been in negotiations with several startups. The company made its first investment in Advanced Farm Technologies in August 2019. One area that has caught Kubota’s attention during the pursuit was “harvesting”, which is, according to Kubota, in high demand among fruit growers. This interest led to the decision to invest in Abundant Robotics as the startup has been developing apple-harvesting robots by using advanced technologies. With this investment, Kubota aims to reinforce its development of labor-saving and automation technology for harvesting apples and other fruits and launch a solution business utilizing these technologies. (SONEAN: what makes this investment especially interesting is that the German cooperative BayWa had invested in Abundant Robotics 3 years ago while Kubota’s previous investment into Advanced Farm Technologies was actually led by Yamaha Motors, which has another investment in a New Zealand startup, called Robotics Plus, also develops harvesting robots. See the context for more background);;"German cooperative BayWa has also invested in Abundant Robotics in May 2017, only one year after the foundation of the startup, becoming a minority shareholder in the company. BayWa’s intention in investing in Abundant Robotics was to support the development of automated harvesting systems for special crops, which according to BayWa is labor-intensive as the farmers face challenges finding enough workforce within cost limits. (https://bit.ly/30hSsxs). Two years after that investment, BayWa’s subsidiary in New Zealand, T & G Global, started to use the picking robot developed by Abundant Robotics, in apple harvesting. According to BayWa it is also possible to use such robots in Germany soon (https://bit.ly/2NkS5gj). 
In November 2018 Yamaha Motors had made a second investment in Robotics Plus, a New Zealand agricultural robotics and automation company, increasing Yamaha’s total investment to USD 10 mn. Among others Robotics Plus develops a robotic kiwifruit harvester (https://bit.ly/2tUNzyj).

CNH-Chef Mühlhäuser: Steyr soll Premium-Marke werden;CNH boss Mühlhäuser: Steyr should become a premium brand;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.landwirt-media.com/cnh-chef-muehlhaeuser-steyr-soll-premium-marke-werden/;2020-01-10;In an interview, Hubertus Mühlhäuser, CEO of CNH Industrial, provided new insights regarding the strategy of CNH for its brands, especially for Steyr. Accordingly, New Holland (NH) is positioned as the wide-ranging full-liner brand with a complete tractor portfolio and deep forage and harvesting equipment ranges. Case IH is also positioned as a full-liner with tractors and harvesting equipment, but more targeting the professional large-scale business segment, and contractors. Steyr is the high-tech brand in the tractor segment and it will bring new technologies onto the market before other brands. It will remain focused on Europe and only appear as a tractor manufacturer, which will make it a complementary partner with other European short-liner manufacturers such as Kuhn, Amazone, Krone, Pöttinger, Lemken or Horsch as these manufacturers look for a premium tractor brand while they get pushed out by the large full-liners. Steyr will soon be represented throughout Europe while the St. Valentin plant will expand its activities with new investments to reach the quality required for the “Made in Austria” production. Steyr will remain rooted in St. Valentin and be connected to his homeland. Although NH’s biogas tractor is already available, Mühlhäuser finds it astonishing that the competitors have not jumped into the biogas train yet. With Steyr’s concept study, presented at Agritechnica 2019, CNH will push hybrid drives, bringing the electrification in combination with diesel or gas engines. Such a hybrid tractor could be ready in few years. (SONEAN: In Austria Steyr is said to be the market leader in the tractor market with more than 20% market share while Case IH has only a marginal share of the market. Therefore, Case IH e.g. will focus on high-performance machines, where the demand is said to be growing in Austria. NH is the number three in the tractor market and has seen steady growth in harvesting equipment during the past two years. Currently, every fourth combine sold in Austria is a NH harvester. See the context for insights about what Mühlhäuser thinks regarding autonomous machines and electric drives as well as why the AgXtend brand was created);;Mühlhäuser also sees an increasing automation of machines towards autonomous driving. The new Case IH Magnum presented at Agritechnica was the logical continuation of the previous autonomous tractor study. In future, there will be more flexible and electric drives as well as a variety of sensors. Tractors will be completely networked to optimise usage and maintenance cycles and will be monitored by the manufacturer via control rooms. The AgXtend brand has been created to work with startups. This way CNH brings experimental technologies to the market. CNH regularly scouts for startups for cooperation and if it finds an exciting solution, it tries to bind the startups to exclusively sell their products through CNH’s networks, and thus piggy back them.;CNH INDUSTRIAL N.V.,New Holland (CNHI),Case IH (CNHI),STEYR Traktoren (CNHI),AgXtend (CNHI),Kuhn (Bucher),Amazone,Krone,Pöttinger,Lemken,Horsch Maschinen GmbH;Austria;Tractors,Harvesters,Strategy,Market Entry,Alliances,Capacity Increase,Alternative Engines,Precision Technology,Implements

SRC’s Wilma is also now in use for commercial weed identification and decision support. Wilma can now detect both broad-leaved weeds and emerging wheat. Collaboration work with Cosmonio is now underway for identification of grass type weeds, the mapping of which is scheduled for next autumn. (SONEAN: A third of the previous crowdfunding raise of SRC came from farmers. These include Andrew Ward, MBE Farmers Weekly Farming Champion & Arable Farmer of the Year, Tom Clarke, Nature Friendly Farmer, NFU Sugar Board, OFC19 Emerging Leader, George Renner, farmer and no-till pioneer, and Tom Jewers who are all members of SRC’s Farmer Advisory Group. The crowdfunding website CrowdCube shows that SRC has raised the required amount 28 days ahead of the planned end of funding, with 580 new investors investing in 8.05% of the equity of the company, https://www.crowdcube.com/investments). See also the context for more details);;"SRC is also using those farmer investors to address the broad public opinion, with the exception of Matt Jones, who is Principal Designer at Google AI. The following opinions are from farmers who have invested in the first round in SRC: 1) “The key advantage of this technology is that it enables us to be much more precise and targeted in controlling weeds besides helping to reduce soil compaction” 2) ""SRC helps farmers to reduce the use of pesticides, encourages wildlife on farm and improve soil health while farming as efficiently as possible to maintain the viability of the farming business”.";Small Robot Company,Innovate UK@Government of the United Kingdom,Waitrose & Partners,National Trust of Scotland,RootWave,Cosmonio;United Kingdom;Precision Technology,Corporate Finance,Product Launches,Alliances,User Insights
WORLD PREMIER: FIRST PLANT-POWERED IOT SENSOR SENDS SIGNAL TO SPACE;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.plant-e.com/en/world-premier-first-plant-powered-iot-sensor-sends-signal-to-space/;2020-01-14;Plant-e (https://www.plant-e.com/), a start-up based in Wageningen in the Netherlands, and Lacuna Space (https://lacuna.space/), a UK and Netherlands based satellite service provider, developed a pilot service using plants as the energy source. Combining the innovative energy harvesting technology developed by Plant-e with the extremely power efficient devices from Lacuna Space, both companies developed the first-ever plant-powered sensor, which has successfully transmitted to a satellite in space. Since the sensor doesn't need batteries, due to the internal storage in the system, it'll reduce costs, maintenance requirements and environmental impact. As long as plants continue to grow, electricity will be produced. The sensor is completely self-sustainable and operates independently from sunlight, day and night. The IoT prototype device uses the electricity generated by living plants to transmit LoRa messages about air humidity, soil moisture, temperature, cell voltage and electrode potential straight to Lacuna's satellite. Future applications may include critical data gathering from agricultural land, rice fields or other aquatic environments without the need for any external energy sources. The pilot service is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA). Lacuna is launching a Low Earth Orbit satellite system that will provide a global IoT service, which allows collecting data from sensors in remote areas with little or no connectivity. Currently Lacuna is offering a pilot service with one satellite with three more awaiting the launch. (SONEAN: Plant-e was founded in 2009 as a Wageningen University spin-off. Via David Strik, who is the co-founder of Plant-e and still works at Wageningen University, the company maintains strong ties to the university.

Kubota Unveils a “Dream Tractor”;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.kubota.com/news/2020/20200115_1.html;2020-01-15;Half century after exhibiting its first-ever concept tractor at Expo 1970 in Osaka, Kubota unveiled at an exhibition in Kyoto in January 2020 a new concept tractor called “X tractor - cross tractor -” to commemorate its 130th anniversary. Since the launch of its AgriRobo tractors in 2017, Kubota has expanded its autonomous agricultural machinery, AgriRobo, Series. The new concept is presented in anticipation of the full-scale introduction of smart farming. Kubota will continue developing technologies for labor-saving and precision farming to address the challenges in Japanese agriculture such the aging of farmers and labor shortage. Kubota’s goal is to achieve a completely autonomous operation. The concept tractor features an advanced design based on a new construction design concept. Its control system uses various data such as weather data and growth rates and chooses the appropriate operation autonomously. The environmental data obtained during operation can be automatically shared with other machines to realize centrally-managed efficient operation in field. The concept is powered by a combination of lithium-ion batteries and solar batteries. The four-wheeled robotic crawler also achieves stable autonomous driving on wet paddies and uneven terrains. It adjusts its height for different operations. The in-wheel motor makes it possible to arbitrarily change the rotation speed of the four crawlers to achieve a small turning radius for autonomous operation on various types of land. (SONEAN: Kubota also presented two purely electric prototypes, one compact tractor and a mini excavator, at the same exhibition. Kubota plans to start tests of the compact electric tractor in France in 2020 while the company also plans to launch both the electrical tractors and electrical compact construction machinery sooner after conducting a series of experiments and evaluations, https://bit.ly/2Rlrq4f. Kubota will also introduce an autonomous rice planter. Moreover, Kubota Australia launched a campaign to help Australian farmers affected by current fires. See the context for details);;"Kubota also unveiled prototypes of electric tractors and electric mini excavators, which are currently under development, at the same exhibition. In response to the global shift towards electric vehicles, Kubota decided to make prototype models of its compact tractors to identify the needs of local users while creating a prototype of construction machinery that shares key electrical components with tractors, in preparation for the development of non-diesel-powered and ultralow-noise construction machinery. Kubota is seemingly about to release a rice planting machine with automated driving functions by using mapping and GPS technology. While a human driver is not necessary with the autonomous machine, it requires a remote controller and will be presented in October 2020 (https://bit.ly/37bDOdv). 
In a bid to raise funds for the farmers affected by fires raging in Australia, Kubota’s subsidiary Kubota Australia has started a cooperation with Lloyds Auctioneers and Valuers, Australian Community Media Agricultural Publishing and Events, and the Country Women's Association of Australia. Kubota Australia has donated two M126GX Tractors, valued in excess of AUD 110,000 each, which will be auctioned by Lloyds. The proceeds will go directly to the Country Women's Association of Australia to be distributed to farmers (https://bit.ly/3abJpTc).";Kubota Corporation,Lloyds Auctioneers and Valuers,Australian Community Media & Printing,Country Women`s Association of Australia;Australia,France,Japan;Precision Technology,Product Launches,Tractors,Other self propelled machinery,Alternative Engines,Alliances,Campaigns,Harvesters

How moisture-seeking drilling kit helps drought-hit Aussies;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.fwi.co.uk/machinery/technology/how-moisture-seeking-drilling-kit-helps-drought-hit-aussies;2020-01-18;A new drilling outfit developed by Australian Moisture Planting Technologies (MPT) is using intelligent moisture-sensing tines to automatically alter sowing depth according to soil conditions. MPT has designed the kit to help farmers avoid unnecessary wear and tear on machines by reducing sowing depth in areas where moisture is present. The kit monitors soil properties (moisture, temperature and pH) and allows the drill to self-adjust to optimise placement. Information from tines is then sent via a local Wi-Fi connection to a tablet in the cab. The tablet gives operators manual control of all functions and a drilling map can be downloaded afterwards to overlay with yield maps. The system is designed to fit most new broadacre drills and offers potential yield increases of up to 10% in the right soil and rainfall conditions. The firm currently has a three-row machine and is developing a 6m toolbar. The long-term aim is to build compete drills, but MPT is currently planning an alternative route to market. Rather than selling them outright, it will lease the drills to farmers in a pay-per-hectare arrangement.

The soft, rubber-like grippers used in practice, on the other hand, soil the objects while their positioning accuracy is also restricted. As part of an ETH Fellowship, a former ETH doctoral student is currently developing a process that can be used to lift and manipulate small objects without touching them. This “touching” becomes possible by an effect that has been used for over 80 years in space research. Ultrasonic waves generate a pressure field that is invisible and audible to humans. By superimposing the acoustic waves, pressure points are created where small objects can be caught. As a result, they seem to hang freely in the air, although they actually hover in the acoustic trap. With the existing technology, the researchers can already move various small parts in the room. The software adapts the gripper to the shape of the object to be lifted, and the robot arm transports it to the destination. The principle of non-contact gripping also has an economic advantage: if you work with a normal robot, you need a separate gripper for almost every new shape. The ultrasonic gripper eliminates the extensive set of high-precision (and expensive) grippers. The robot arm itself doesn't even have to be very precise. If the researcher succeeds in the tests outside the laboratory by spring 2021, he plans to start a company with his business idea.;;;ETH Zurich;Switzerland;Precision Technology,Innovation

Digital Fertilization;;Universities and Multipliers;https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/35871/;2020-01-22;Researchers at the TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan started a three-year research project in January 2020 to extensively test two digital instruments that help farmers save fertilizer and reduce the burden on the environment. The first is a modular, web-based management system which enables farmers not only to precisely determine the nutrient and fertilizer needs of their plants, but also to optimize fertilizer distribution under crop rotation. The second is a special multispectral sensor that can be attached to the tractor. It measures the light reflected by the crop to calculate the nitrogen nutritional status of the plants. The system also takes account of the growth stage, soil quality and the desired product quality, and then calculates the optimum amount of fertiliser to be applied. A single operation is therefore enough to measure the current nitrogen content of the plant and to adjust the level of fertilizer applied in real time.;;;Technical University of Munich;Germany;Precision Technology,Digitalization

The study shows that HSD kills nearly 100% of the seeds. The researchers collected seeds from 10 common weed species in soybean fields in the U.S. Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. They fed the seeds through a stationary HSD, and then tried germinating them in a greenhouse and in the field following a typical Illinois winter. 0 to 15% of the seeds appeared to be undamaged immediately after milling, regardless of species and seed size. When the undamaged seeds were buried in the field and left through the winter, fewer than 10% survived. The researchers think that the microscopic abrasions from the impact mill damage the seed coat enough for microbes to enter and destroy the embryonic weed inside. The researchers have been conducting U.S. field trials with HSD for five years and the typical reduction in weed seed rain has been by 70 to 80% on the field. According to them, this recent result is due to the efficacy of the stationary device. Based on the overall results, the researchers propose a new tactic which needs to be integrated into weed management in general to be effective. 
(SONEAN: Seed Terminator, an Australian competitor of HSD, just announced a new technology while starting a new campaign and providing discounts. Via its Twitter account, Seed Terminator announced that using a patented aero-dynamic turbulence technology called aeroimpact3 and a new multistage hammer mill its product can now reduce weed seed up 99% during the harvest, https://bit.ly/394i7gi.

Israeli researchers unveil first all-optical ‘stealth’ encryption tech;;Universities and Multipliers;https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-researchers-unveil-first-all-optical-stealth-encryption-tech-615762;2020-01-29;Researchers at BGN Technologies, the technology transfer company of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), on Wednesday unveiled what they described as the “first all-optical encryption technology.” It provides significantly more secure and “stealthy” transmission of highly sensitive information, they said. While information is usually encrypted using digital techniques, most data is transmitted over distance using the light spectrum on fiber-optic networks. Instead of using one color of the light spectrum to send one large data stream, the research team’s patented method uses standard optical equipment to spread the transmitted data across many colors in the optical spectrum bandwidth. According to the researchers, the innovative solution essentially renders the fiber-optic light transmission “invisible,” enabling the transmission of weaker-encrypted data in streams hidden under increased noise levels. The team is now seeking a commercial partner to advance the technology.;;;BGN Technologies,Ben-Gurion University of the Negev;Israel;Innovation,Precision Technology

According to the company, the growth it has experienced in the past 4 years reflects a strong and trusting relationship with Claas. DA also represents New Holland in Poland and AGCO in the Czech Republic.
(SONEAN: DA's overall turnover increased in 2019 by 7% to a record of EUR 4.7 bn. The company’s earnings have been also influenced by very low yields from the group’s shares in German Agravis whose earnings were hit by extraordinary costs “in connection with the end of a year-long trial”. DA sets now ambitious financial targets for 2020, including a consolidated turnover of EUR 4.7-4.8 bn and an investment of EUR 40 mn, https://bit.ly/2SBsem4. In 2019 DA sold 2,050 tractors and 450 combine harvesters, new and used. For 2020 machinery sales of DA are expected to increase to around DKK 5 bn (EUR 736 mn) after inclusion of the business in the Baltic countries while the company expects sales of 2,200 tractors and 600 combine harvesters, both new and used, https://bit.ly/2vtBm4f. After investing in FieldSense and Grainit within its digitalisation strategy, DA has just signed an new agreement with Canadian SoilOptix to offer the digital analysis scanner of the company in Nordic and Baltic markets. See the context for more details)";;Since 2018 DA has come a long way with its digitalisation strategy. DA has entered into partnerships and invested in companies. One such an investment was in FieldSense, which offers weather stations. There are currently already 1,000 FieldSense weather stations used in Denmark.

Basic Management Policy and Priority Measures 2020;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.kubota.com/company/ir/financial/presentation/pdf/mp131e.pdf;2020-02-19;Japanese manufacturer Kubota Corporation published a new document about its basic management policy and priority measures. After creating a concrete plan of advanced development, the company has already invested in Advanced Farm Technologies and Abundant Robotics while also establishing an office at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. The plan, dubbed Mid Term Business Plan, foresees three themes with impact in various regions. The first theme is about the continuous growth of the company in its core business. In North America and Thailand this should follow by deepening business opportunity by expanding the product lineup while in Japan the development of smart farming and total solutions as countermeasures against aging and labor shortage have priority. Expanding its strategic business is another theme, which anticipates the start of domestic production in India and an accelerated growth in ASEAN countries ex Thailand. In Europe and North America Kubota plans to come up with large sized farm equipment to increase its market presence. Developing its business in “emerging markets” (i.e. Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Turkey) will be dealt “promptly” with utilizing “outside resources”. (SONEAN: see the context for other relevant insights from the plan. At the 2020 National Farm Machinery Show in Louisville, USA, Kubota announced the availability of the new M8 Series tractor, its largest and highest horsepower tractor series manufactured by Canadian Buhler Industries, starting 1 March 2020, https://bit.ly/2P6KNxn);;Another interesting aspect of the plan is the creation and provision of total solutions through digital transformation. Those total solutions are also divided into three areas, one for stakeholders (customers, dealers and suppliers), another for Kubota itself to transform the operation and production processes. The third one is for the customers to whom Kubota aims to deliver an expanding lineup of automatic driving products and services while also utilizing new technologies like AR and sensors. It is also interesting to note that besides the core businesses of farm equipment, engines and construction machinery Kubota aims to also expand its Water & Environment business, which includes membrane solutions and water pipes.;Kubota Corporation,Wageningen Universiteit en Researchcentrum,Advanced Farm Technologies,Abundant Robotics;Japan,Netherlands,Thailand,Turkey;Reporting,Strategy,Market Entry,Tractors,>100 HP,Digitalization,Precision Technology

Swarming robots avoid collisions, traffic jams;;Universities and Multipliers;https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/02/swarming-robots-avoid-collisions-traffic-jams/;2020-02-24;For self-driving vehicles to become an everyday reality, they need to safely and flawlessly navigate with one another without crashing or causing unnecessary traffic jams. To help make this possible, Northwestern University researchers have developed the first decentralized algorithm with a collision-free, deadlock-free guarantee. The researchers tested the algorithm in a simulation of 1,024 robots and on a swarm of 100 real robots in the laboratory. The robots reliably, safely and efficiently converged to form a pre-determined shape in less than a minute. The advantage of a swarm of small robots versus one large robot or a swarm with one lead robot is the lack of a centralized control, which can quickly become a central point of failure. The new decentralized algorithm acts as a fail-safe.;;;Northwestern University;United States;Innovation,Precision Technology

John Deere AutoTrac Controller 300 Expands Automated Steering to More AG Machines;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.deere.com/en/our-company/news-and-announcements/news-releases/2020/agriculture/2020feb11-autotrac-controller-300/;2020-03-03;"John Deere (JD) announced that its AutoTrac Controller 300 is now available as an “easy and less expensive” universal after-market steering kit for a wide variety of non-guidance-ready machine platforms. According to JD, the new universal after-market kit gives producers the benefits of integrated AutoTrac precision guidance with “no impact on operator ergonomics and no steering wheel modifications” while being customizable to different types, ages and brands of ag machines that have hydraulic steering from a single source and at least four wheels. The steering solution is compatible with newer JD vehicles not equipped with AutoTrac as well as older machines and other equipment brands as it integrates with a JD precision ag display and StarFire receiver for a complete guidance system. The kit requires no modifications to the original steering wheel or operator area but utilizes hydraulic and electrical components that provide quick guidance line acquisition with “the feel and function of a fully integrated system”. Later in 2020, JD plans to expand compatibility to machines other than tractors. It will be used on cabbed or open-station JD and other brands of ag machines with front- or rear-wheel steering and will be compatible with both open- and closed-center hydraulic systems.
(SONEAN: In 2019 JD launched a separate website for the AutoTrac Universal 300 Package. That website, https://atu300.deere.com/, has now also been adopted to the new announcement of JD and features videos that show various non-JD machines operating with the ATU300 package, including Massey Ferguson, Case IH, New Holland and Deutz-Fahr tractors and Claas combines. The website also prominently features a Fendt tractor. Moreover, the kit is now also positioned as a portable automated steering solution that can be used on over 600 approved machines from JD and other brands. With the kit it becomes also possible for the owners of non-JD machines to use JD’s Operations Centre. The kit is now also available in new countries including Turkey.

With a speaker and four microphones, drones can echolocate like bats;;Universities and Multipliers;https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q1/with-a-speaker-and-four-microphones,-drones-can-echolocate-like-bats.html;2020-03-04;Scientists from Purdue University and the Technical University of Munich found a method to hear the shape of a room using four microphones mounted on a drone, similar to how bats use echolocation to orient themselves with their surroundings. The scientists have worked to reconstruct the wall configuration of rooms by using echoes picked up by microphones on the drone. When a microphone hears an echo, the time difference between the moment the sound was produced and the time it was heard is recorded. That time difference shows the distance travelled by the sound after bouncing on a wall. The research proves that it’s possible for a minimal setup of four microphones arranged in a non-planar shape, along with just a loudspeaker emitting one signal, to reconstruct a room. This echolocation research could be applied in numerous ways. Having more signal input would prevent solely relying on one type of input, like car backup cameras, and improve the chances that objects could be detected more accurately and in a wider variety of conditions.;;;Purdue University,Technical University of Munich;Germany,United States;Innovation,Precision Technology
SMART AGRI TECHNOLOGY EN ABEMEC WERKEN SAMEN;SMART AGRI TECHNOLOGY AND ABEMEC WORK TOGETHER;Intermediaries and customers;https://www.abemec.nl/smart-agri-technology-en-abemec-werken-samen/;2020-03-05;Abemec (part of Agrimec Holding, a company that focuses on customized mechanization for the professional agricultural entrepreneur and belongs to German BayWa), an AGCO partner, in the Netherlands, is now cooperating with the Dutch precision agriculture startup Smart Agri Technology (SAT, https://www.smartagritechnology.com/). Abemec will make its knowledge and experience as well as service and maintenance options available to SAT, which will make the use of its robotic solutions more accessible to the market. The collaboration will provide SAT the opportunity to offer products from, among others, NAIO Technologies and AgroIntelli from Abemec`s Smart Farming activities in Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe. The service for these products will continue to be provided by Abemec. With the help of Abemec and its knowledge of cultivation, technology and soil, SAT is said to raise cultivation among Dutch farmers to a higher level by improving it as well as soil quality with new technology. By deploying precision farming techniques and robotics to agricultural companies on a rental basis, the customers can become acquainted with and benefit from the most modern technology with optimum preservation of soil and cultivation quality, without having to make an investment and run a risk. (SONEAN: In February 2020 Smart Agri Technology had invested in two Robotti robots from Danish manufacturer AgroIntelli with the aim to offer autonomous services to arable farmers in the Netherlands. Abemec furthermore visited the official launch of the new Robotti robot in Denmark and provided insights into its own and its parent BayWa’s robotic business. Abemec considers Naio’s robots to be much more useful in vegetable farming and horticulture in smaller areas while the Robotti represents for the Dutch company the best available ROI solution for robotic agriculture. See the context for details, and also its expectation with regard to future sales);;Abemec’s Product Manager for Smart Farming, Klaas Jan Hommes, visited Denmark to see the official launch of the new version of Robotti manufactured by Danish company AgroIntelli. After the demonstration of the new Danish robot, the manager explained that Abemec has the opportunity to try out the future of the engineering business of its German parent BayWa. This was the reason why Abemec has secured the agency of AgroIntelli in the Netherlands. Besides Robotti, Abemec sells also French Naio Technologies' robots. Naio has so far produced a lot more robots than AgroIntelli. So far, 15-16 Robotti units have been sold in 2020, the vast majority outside Denmark. The first three Robotti robots were sold in the Netherlands and according to Abemec the potential for more is definitely present. Although the manager cannot say a specific sales number, he thinks that only the sky is the limit.

THE UNBEATEN;;Intermediaries and customers;https://www.deere.co.uk/en/campaigns/large-tractors/;2020-03-05;"John Deere (JD) started a new campaign in the UK dubbed “The Unbeaten”, which is related to its above 150 hp tractors and positioned with 3 Ps; protect, perform and profit. According to JD its 7R, 8R, 8RT, 8RX tractors series are “unbeaten in comfort” with the CommandPRO joystick, Active Seat II and infotainment system. Another “unbeaten” feature of its tractors are their cost per hour, since they come with “exceptionally low consumption, guaranteed efficiency and resale values “. With a warranty extension of up to 8 years / 8,000 hours the customers are called to have “total peace of mind”. For this claim, JD offers its cost of ownership calculator with which the customers can see the per hour cost of a tractor before acquiring it. JD also uses its Fuel Guarantee Program to reinforce this claim. The final “unbeaten” feature of JD tractors is the one of Precision Ag via its connectivity solutions. Based on the 450 EUR/ha wheat production cost, the use of JD’s connectivity solutions are said to help save customers up to 57 EUR/ha. This claim is calculated based on data from different European countries (mainly from the UK, France and Germany) and some assumptions how the tractors and connectivity solutions should be used.

Autonomous vehicles can be fooled to ‘see’ nonexistent obstacles;;Universities and Multipliers;https://theconversation.com/autonomous-vehicles-can-be-fooled-to-see-nonexistent-obstacles-129427;2020-03-06;Most current autonomous vehicles rely on multiple sensors to perceive their surroundings, using a combination of cameras, radar and LiDAR sensors. However, these systems are not foolproof. A research team from the University of Michigan and UC Irvine has shown that the LiDAR-based perception system can be tricked by spoofing their sensor signals. With that attack the vehicle’s LiDAR-based perception system perceived a nonexistent obstacle. In real life, such a spoofed vehicle could cause a crash by blocking traffic or braking abruptly, https://bit.ly/2v66h6S. Researchers from Deakin University in Australia furthermore created an imitation learning technique, also called learning from demonstration, solely from the images taken by the cameras attached to a vehicle onto its front and sides. The data coming from those cameras “combined with the knowledge gained from observing the human operator” trigger the vehicle to fully stop to avoid an accident. With imitation learning the training process of autonomous systems gets accelerated while reducing the amount of training data required to produce a good model, compared to “classical AI” techniques, https://bit.ly/2vPk0ze.;;;University of Michigan,University of California Irvine,Deakin University;Australia,United States;Innovation,Precision Technology

The company is implementing its technological changes and continues to invest significantly in marketing and R&D. A good example is Air Drive, the solution developed by Berthoud to reduce dispersion, and limit the quantities applied. At FIMA 2020 the three-arm Axiale boom was also presented for the first time in Spain. After consolidating its presence in Western Europe and the CIS countries, Berthoud aims to conquer the markets of the United States, in partnership with its sister company ET Works, and China where Berthoud plans to open a subsidiary in the near future. The company is also realising new innovations around precision agriculture, electronics, robotization and AI systems such as those developed by Carbon Bee and Bilberry, as we had related to in earlier communication. (SONEAN: in 2020 Berthoud started in several European countries a new round of tests of new spraying solutions the company has been developing with Carbon Bee and Bilberry, which has been described as “the spraying solution of tomorrow” by one French farmer. This second round testing is seen as vital before marketing the solutions, meaning that they may come to the market already in 2021, https://bit.ly/39Wpuaa. The intelligent spraying system developed together with Carbon Bee is called SmartStriker and reportedly offers key herbicide savings between 50 and 80%, https://bit.ly/3393gzu. See the context for the technical details of the Air Drive system and the Axiale boom);;Berthoud’s Air Drive consists of air-assisted sprayers for wide or narrow vines, which enables sprayers designed for spraying on each side of the rows. Air Drive sprayers can be equipped with air injection nozzles to increase the size of the drops and greatly reduce dispersion. They optimise on each row side throughout the season by adjusting the height of coverage, air assistance and the size of the drops according to plant growth phase. The Air Drive air-assisted sprayers are equipped with diffusers with an integrated nozzle, which generate a flow of air loaded with droplets. The position of the nozzle in relation to the airflow has been determined so as to obtain a consistent spread of the spray and maximum coverage height. The compact boom Axiale comes with a 3-arm steel folding and is integrated into the body of the trailed sprayer Vantage.

John Deere Launches Two Key Initiatives at CONEXPO-CON/AGG With Performance Tiering and Certified Rebuild Centers;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.deere.com/en/our-company/news-and-announcements/news-releases/2020/construction/2020mar10-conexpo-key-initiatives/;2020-03-10;At CONEXPO-CON/AGG 2020 John Deere (JD) is launching two key initiatives: Performance Tiering and Certified Rebuild Centers. Beginning in 2021, Performance Tiering will roll out within select new construction and compact machine categories. Machines will be designated as a G tier, P tier or X tier. The tiers are defined by different equipment attributes, ranging from application life, performance, serviceability, innovation and operator comfort, each at different price levels. G-tier models provide proven capabilities and value with the reliability and ruggedness. P-tier models are high-production machines for daily use with advanced features. X-tier models will offer a premium edge with JD’s most innovative technology and features. Based on a pilot project of several of dealerships in 2019, JD furthermore prepared a program, which comes with machine rebuild options to extend the life of older JD machines with enhancements to the Powertrain ReLife Plus program, the new John Deere Certified Rebuild Centers that are dealer facilities certified by JD for performing machine rebuilds. By the end of 2020, all JD dealer groups will have at least one location certified to perform machine rebuilds at their facilities. The new centers will use consistent processes to inspect the condition of a machine and assess its performance. Once that machine’s specific needs are understood and communicated to the customer, a customized rebuild plan will be developed based on the customer’s needs and the rebuild will be conducted by certified technicians. (SONEAN: Caterpillar had introduced its Rebuild program, and it is likely that we will soon see this applied to major and expensive ag machinery as well, that`s why we picked up this development here. JD will also showcase its engines, including new ones, and engine options along with new technology offerings and the first compact machine with Integrated Grade Control for the construction industry. This includes the redesigned 13.6 l engine, which will offer new levels of performance, serviceability and integration. Building on the design of the 13.6 l engine, JD is also introducing a new 18.0 l engine with maximum power over 650 kW. See the context for among others more details on JD's engines);;The new 18.0 l engine is equipped with JD engine controls, a high-pressure common-rail fuel system and series turbochargers and utilizes cooled EGR. The new engine will be manufactured in the Waterloo plant while its production is planned to begin in 2022. For its 4.5 l engine JD will offer options for a range of applications, including single and series turbo performance engines covering 63 to 129 kW in configurations with and without a DPF for both variable and constant speed markets. Additionally, no-EGR engines are available at 55 kW and constant speed ratings to satisfy the 80 kVA and 100 kVA markets. JD is also expanding its no-EGR offering to include variable speed ratings with and without a DPF, as well as constant speed ratings for the no-DPF market.

Succesvolle dealerstrategie John Deere niet in beton gegoten;Successful dealer strategy of John Deere not cast in concrete;Intermediaries and customers;https://www.melkveebedrijf.nl/nieuwsartikel/2020/succesvolle-dealerstrategie-john-deere-niet-in-beton-gegoten/b24g4c53o6126/;2020-03-10;According to the Country Manager of John Deere (JD) in the Netherlands, Cor Kramer, the country is at the forefront of the implementation of JD`s Dealer of Tomorrow strategy. JD does not see the ongoing consolidation as an ultimate goal in itself. Whereas in Germany there is currently uneasiness due to the ongoing reorganisation, the strategy in the Netherlands was started in 2011 with the aim of having only 9 dealers in the country. In that year JD had a tractor market share of 17%. In 2019 this figure rose to above 23%, showing that the strategy is potentially working. The recent takeover of the dealer Jan de Winkel (https://www.jandewinkel.nl/) by the larger GroeNoord (https://www.groenoordbv.nl/) is another indication that the strategy is going ahead as planned. GroeNoord had acquired Greve, another JD dealer, in 2017, and has become now a major dealer with nineteen branches in the north and east of the Netherlands. The closure of JD’s sales office at its Horst facility in December 2019 is in line with the reorganisation and professionalisation envisaged by JD. In 2011 Horst was home to a team of 16 people. With the further professionalisation and merger of dealers, the team decreased to six people who work from home since there is still a need for outside service. All other previous functions at Horst including marketing have been transferred to Walldorf in Germany. (SONEAN: the new head of John Deere Polska, Leszczy?ski, who executed JD’s new strategy in the Netherlands before, stated in a new interview that the number of JD dealers in the whole of Poland may drop to 4-5 while the number of outlets will stay the same, https://bit.ly/2U4x0t2. In Germany JD dealer Stücker Landtechnik, https://stuecker.de/, was not surprised with the new strategy as JD’s concept was actually launched already in 2006 and the current coercive push by JD is rather a result of the changes in competition and expectations of customers. Stücker has been profiting from the new strategy, opening additional locations in its contract territories to align with the strategy, https://bit.ly/2TPNcy0. Stücker was founded in 1935, has 150 employees, and seemingly generated EUR 58 mn in revenues in 2019. It is also a dealer of Kramer, JCB, Kuhn, Köckerling as well as Kotte. At ExpoAgro exhibition in Argentina JD will furthermore present its new M4040 sprayer while its Argentinian subsidiary PLA introduces a range of novelties. Ukrainian JD dealer Agrosem sold a JD R4060 self-propelled sprayer to the agricultural producer LLC Ukraine. The dealer celebrated this sale in a separate event as it seemingly represents the first sale of that large sprayer in Europe, https://bit.ly/39MJNaf. See also the context for more details with regard to JD in Argentina);;At ExpoAgro exhibition in March 2020 in Argentina JD is to present the new M4040 sprayer, which will complete the M4000 series with the existing models M4025 and M4030. This sprayer which we had related to earlier comes with a 30-metre steel or 36-metre carbon fibre boom and has a tank capacity of 4000 litre. Visitors to JD’s stand will have also access to expanded after-sales and training services of JD, including a financing option and five after-sales service packages. The stand of PLA, JD’s Argentinian subsidiary, will be close to JD’s stand to highlight the importance of the growing of the Argentinian company together with its U.S. parent.

The meeting was the starting point of an information platform JD-UA is now setting up to shorten the way for Ukrainian farmers to find a company that can offer precision farming services to them. On that platform JD-UA aims to present the best companies, which can provide precision farming concepts from agrochemical research to workflow systems. In the future, the platform will act as a quick and efficient solution to find a provider for precision farming systems since the company sees market demand for such a cooperation between farmers and precision farming companies. Although farmers need such solutions, it is difficult for them to understand the value of the product in the first place even if they find the right tool for their needs. JD’s role in this cooperation is to provide tools while establishing contact between farmers and providers. The company will present “the most suitable solutions for the Ukrainian market” since a solution in one market, say in the USA, works differently compared to another geography like China or Ukraine. (SONEAN: Among the precision farming companies leveraged by JD into the Ukranian market are e.g. Agricon, Agritask, OneSoil, Hummingbird Technologies, Cropio, CPS, Bridges, Taranis and PreAgri.com. It is not clear yet whether JD plans to introduce the Ukrainian information platform into other markets. For its Operations Center JD started now a new information campaign in France, promoting it using farmers and contractors as credibility sources. See the context for more details);;For its French Operations Center campaign JD has chosen “simple-to-understand” phrases from its customers. For instance, one farmer states that he uses the Operations Center “to make decisions based on facts” while a contractor uses it “to help his customers do a better job”. JD also highlights 3 features of the platform to convince its customers. Accordingly, the platform is an “open” one in which data can be imported / exported in ISOXML format by any compatible system. In addition, direct data exchange with Claas Telematics, 365 Farmnet, AFS Connect of Case IH, MyPLM Connect of New Holland and S-Fleet of Steyr is also possible via DataConnect.

Elektrische autonome veldspuit met 10 meter boom;Electric and autonomous sprayer with 10 meter boom;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.mechaman.nl/landbouwmechanisatie/2020/03/17/elektrische-autonome-veldspuit-met-10-meter-boom/;2020-03-17;At the ExpoAgro 2020 exhibition, in Argentina, Plantium (https://plantium.com/), an Argentinian manufacturer of precision agriculture products, showed an autonomous sprayer called Terran, which can reduce the use of chemicals by up to 90% via site-specific spraying, according to the company. The sprayer is electrically powered and can operate on one charge for 8 hours while charging of the batteries takes 3-4 hours. The sprayer comes with a tank capacity of 600 litres while its boom has a working width of 10 metres. The autonomous sprayer can drive up to 18 km/h on the field. For autonomous driving the machine uses the road maps that are used in the same way as the autopilot function of tractors and self-propelled drivers and determines the start and end points using maps. In the future, it is also planned to equip the robot also with a weather station, measuring wind speed, humidity and temperature. Based on these variables, the software will control drift reduction, among other things. (SONEAN: Terran works with two alternatives as a power source. One consists of a generator that charges the batteries to provide autonomy for 8 hours or the batteries run directly the machine, https://bit.ly/2TUstKW. http://afa.afascl.coop/en/quienes.php. Another interesting point is that multiple Terran units can be synchronised to be operated simultaneously, https://bit.ly/3a91cKx. According to its website, Plantium has various strategic partnerships e.g. with AGCO and Argentinian manufacturers Vassalli Fabril, Pauny, Agrometal, Metalfor, Tanzi, Praba, and John Deere's subsidiary PLA. See the context for more details about Terran);;Terran, which will hit the market in the coming months, is operated by means of a tablet that will be delivered to the customer at the time of purchase. The sprayer comes with a low weight of 1,000 kg, which reduces compaction in field work. The autonomous sprayer has also sensors to detect obstacles at a distance of 15 metres. In case of an obstacle the robot stops the move until the obstacle is removed (https://bit.ly/38Xy5s2). Terran can also be controlled manually via the tablet, seemingly as an alternative in case of failures within the communication network.

SwarmFarm goes global with agricultural robots;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.futurefarming.com/Machinery/Articles/2020/3/SwarmFarm-goes-global-with-agricultural-robots-552240E/;2020-03-19;"Australia robotics firm SwarmFarm is raising AUD 6 mn (USD 3.6 mn) to upscale the company. After 8 years in Australia SwarmFarm is planning to go global. The company is currently developing a strategy for the expansion. The plan will be formed within the next six months and will depend on the countries the company will enter first. According to SVG Ventures, a Silicon Valley investment firm, SwarmFarm has great opportunities in the USA. After its progress in Australia in the past 8 years, the company needs to get into major farms on the west coast for scaling up. The company has already sold 8 robots commercially, which are used every day. 
SwarmFarm’s robots are just over 2,000 kg as the focus of the company is to reduce weight and soil compaction. The robots work with a 75 hp diesel engine. SwarmFarm is currently working on a docking and refueling station for its autonomous robots to keep the weight of robots down. Since the robots work like a base platform, customers choose the implements with which the robot is equipped. Currently, the majority of robots are used with spot spraying technology on board, but some also with mower decks or slashers. Recently SwarmFarm announced building robots with an autonomous fertiliser spreader and with flower counting and thinning technology. The company is also looking at mechanical weeding and also considering microwave technology for killing weeds. All of the new functionality will be done through partnerships with other companies. SwarmFarm also states that it has been receiving inquiries about electric drives, however since electrification is not an urgent topic for its growth plans, the company will consider electric drives only in the future. 
(SONEAN: see the context for more insights into SwarmFarm’s business and two cooperations the company started in 2019 with Green Atlas and Roesner)";;Seemingly the robots are also used in horticulture where SwarmFarm’s robots are bigger than some of the machines used traditionally. Therefore, the company is looking at building smaller robots in the future as well. SwarmFarm received a grant of AUD 250.000 from the Queensland government and is in the process of building a new head office in Gindie, a small locality in Queensland, with the help of that grant. For SwarmFarm the cooperation with other companies is seemingly a means of adding new functionality to its platform. In 2019 the company started a cooperation with Green Atlas (https://greenatlas.com.au/) to develop a new robot for flower counting and thinning in apple orchards. The new robots are expected to be released to the market already in 2020 (https://bit.ly/2vMxvjd). In the same year SwarmFarm also started another cooperation with Australian spreader manufacturer Roesner (https://roesner.com.au/) to develop a fertiliser spreader robot (https://bit.ly/3ajoTQ7).;SwarmFarm Robotics,SVG Ventures,Green Atlas,Roesner Pty Ltd;Australia,United States;Precision Technology,Capacity Increase,Market Entry,Strategy,Alliances,Corporate Finance,Alternative Engines,Product Upgrades,Implements

Changing the Future of Agriculture! Researchers, Farmers and Engineers Taking on the Challenge of Robot Tractor Development;;Intermediaries and customers;https://www.yanmar.com/global/about/ymedia/people/robot_tractor.html;2020-03-24;In an interview three players of agricultural robotization expressed their views on various issues regarding the topic and agriculture in Japan – Professor Noboru Noguchi of Hokkaido University, Hisashi Miura of Miura Farm Co Ltd and Shigemi Hidaka of Yanmar – who all played an important role in the development of the robotic tractors at Yanmar. The interworking of multiple tractors on a field and their simultaneous and coordinated operation goes back to the ideas developed by the field farmer Miura during his graduate study at Hokkaido University. Since the university has a close cooperation with Yanmar, the idea was picked up by the company. The common project drew attention from the public, earning Yanmar the 7th Robotics Award of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2016. After the establishment of safety maintenance guidelines based on the ideas of Miura, the project resulted in the presentation of Yanmar’s autonomous tractor in October 2018. According to the partners, this cooperation between a research institution, farmer and manufacturer greatly contributed to the success of bringing the robot tractor product to the market in May 2019. Besides representing a possible solution to the problems of Japanese agriculture such as labour shortages, aging farmers and the lack of expert skills these players think that the futures of robotic agricultural equipment will be the miniaturization and development of smart machinery. According to them the current robotic agricultural equipment is crafted with large-scale farms in mind, but serious labour shortages actually occur in small-scale farms, which need smaller robotic agricultural equipment to reduce their cost. (SONEAN: The next step of these robot tractors will be increasing the types of work that they can perform from sowing, to spraying and harvesting, indicating that the research with Hokkaido University and Yanmar is going into that direction. See also the context for more insights);;The three players also think that robot tractors that can work simultaneously with each other will be the basis of the future of agriculture since such tractors can accumulate data about the fields while performing the real task in an efficient manner. Another interesting insight for the solution of the problems in agriculture in Japan is the creation of an agricultural industry with a market-in approach considering the whole industrial value chain from production to processing and distribution, all the way to the consumer, not only in Japan but in the whole of Asia.;Hokkaido University,Yanmar,Miura Farm Co Ltd,Ministry of Agriculture  Forestry and Fisheries@Government of Japan;Japan;Precision Technology,Strategy,User Insights,Alliances,Reporting

Searching for a sustainable farming future;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.yanmar.com/us/about/ymedia/people/sustainable_farming_future.html;2020-03-27;Yanmar R&D Europe, Yanmar’s European research facility in Italy has been participating in the 2-year, EUR 4 mn SMASH project in cooperation with various technology partners to develop a mobile agricultural “eco-system”, which now turned out to be a modular robotic platform that examines crops and soils and analyses the information to provide actionable information for crop management. SMASH consists of a mobile base, a robotic arm featuring manipulators and vision systems, a drone and an ancillary ground station. SMASH is actually not a single machine, but a series of different devices. SMASH can be programmed for a specific task. It moves autonomously, monitoring crops, detecting and treating diseases. In addition to all the functions performed by the robotic arm, there are also some attachments that can be mounted on the back of the vehicle for mechanical weeding or working the soil. This work can be done simultaneously with the monitoring and detection tasks. Yanmar developed the control systems for the multipurpose robotic arm for mobile manipulation (including precision spraying), sensor integration for positioning technologies, and autonomous navigation as well as the software for the control of the system’s mobile base. The project is co-financed by the Tuscany local government while the partners involved in the project include EDI, Base s.r.l., Seintech, Florence University, IIT (Italian Institute of Technology), Copernico and DORIAN. (SONEAN: The SMASH project is realized as part of Yanmar’s strategy called “A Sustainable Future”, which uses ICT and IoT to develop new technologies. As part of the same strategy Yanmar developed a yield sensor for combine harvesters. See the context for the details of the new sensor);;Yanmar has developed a system for combine harvesters that works by measuring the quantity of harvested grain as it moves through the combine harvester in real time. The system for the visualization of yield has now been installed on models of head-feeding combine harvesters. Yanmar has also developed a yield sensor (YM-KIT, 1150) that can be fitted to full-feeding combine harvesters. The system is currently able to perform real-time measurement/visualization of the rate of harvest and cumulative yield for rice and wheat.

With coronavirus outbreak demand for remote monitoring systems is growing rapidly;;Competitors and Suppliers;http://metos.at/de/demand-for-remote-monitoring-systems-is-growing-rapidly/;2020-03-30;According to Gottfried Pessl, President and Founder of Austrian Pessl Instruments, remote monitoring systems for fields became an urgent solution for farmers as more countries shut down and implement travel restrictions due to the current Coronavirus crisis. Every trip to the field costs time and money and due to the outbreak, it may also be impossible to check all crops with a visit. Remote monitoring provides the opportunity to identify problems timely without visiting the field. One U.S. Pessl Instruments consultant based in California, who used to travel around 80,000 km a year although his radius was only 150 km, reduced the road time by 70% while increasing business by 200%. Pessl Instruments has over 100.000 daily FieldClimate users, and according to the company the demand for Pessl Instruments' equipment has been increasing daily because of the Coronavirus and coming from different parts of world, from USA to Turkey. Pessl works with tens of thousands of consultants all over the globe who support farmers with sometimes completely random day to day visits. The company is now offering special starter kits for consultants who are not yet familiar or experienced with its equipment and technology but want to dive into the remote 24/7 monitoring world. Such consultants are asked to contact Gottfried Pessl personally via e-mail or his LinkedIn account. (SONEAN: recently, Pessl created a new online certification program that can be used both by farmers and consultants. Also recently, two videos appeared showing a California-based consultant and a Turkish customer praising Pessl’s equipment, giving the impression that these are concerted actions as part of a marketing strategy to push Pessl Instruments during the Coronavirus period);;Recently, Pessl Instruments created a new website for Canada while also launching the METOS Certification Program in a new eLearning portal (https://bit.ly/3azauPQ). The program offers a remote training and certification on demand. The training comes with a package that contains both the METOS equipment and required software. The online portal provides for all training material needed for interested farmers and consultants (https://bit.ly/39vfC6y). Recently, an interview with a California-based Pessl Instruments consultant appeared in the U.S. media. Although it is not clear whether it is the same consultant mentioned by Gottfried Pessl, the consultant states that with Pessl’s equipment farmers save money and make more profit (https://bit.ly/2URCmbo).

According to JD, this sale is one of the largest deals it has made since 2014 and Astarta is now on the way to becoming the largest operator of JD equipment. According to Astarta the decision to choose a manufacturer was not easy because of the many offers it received. Before making a decision, the company held several stages of negotiations with manufacturers and dealers. Astarta required the service companies to be located closer than 100 km from its sites. Considering the features of tractors such as power, energy efficiency, auto-steering systems, and most importantly the availability of highly professional and qualified after-sales service, and studying the cost of service support, Astarta saw it economically justified to purchase JD tractors. Other important factors for Astarta were two years of warranty, favourable payment terms and availability and timely delivery of machines before spring field work. Although there were some delivery problems due to the quarantine regime introduced in Ukraine, JD could fulfil its obligations and delivered the machines on time at the beginning of March 2020. Beside tractors, Astarta’s investment program covers also sprayers and seeder/planters. Therefore, the company also purchased 21 units from Horsch, Pöttinger, Kinze, Monopil, Amity Technology. Astarta’s previous Kinze planters were mechanical, the new Kinze planters are pneumatic ones. Astarta will continue to focus on upgrading its tractors and sprayers and also plans to purchase several grain seed drills. The company will decide later on when to replace tillage equipment including ploughs, disc harrows and cultivators. (SONEAN: see the context on how JD thinks it won the deal and which dealers will service Astarta. In 2019 revenues of Astarta increased by 20% to EUR 448 mn while its EBITDA increased by 15% to EUR 78 mn. The revenues in the Agriculture segment increased by 62% to EUR 206 mn. Exports contributed EUR 253 mn, or 56% of the company’s revenues, https://bit.ly/2Ve89oo);;After signing the deal with Astarta JD stated that its Ukrainian dealer network has developed significantly over the past 4 years. The number of technical service sites operated by dealers has more than doubled and the number of other outlets and service points has increased to 35. Since, based on JD’s availability criteria, Ukrainian dealers receive weekly spare part deliveries from JD’s European Parts Distribution Center, this was an important factor in winning the deal. In addition, JD also benefited from the fact that Astarta already had acquired about 40 self-propelled sprayers and high power tractors from JD since 2010. 4 JD dealers will now service Astarta’s new tractors: Agristar in the Poltava region, Jupiter 9 in the Chernihiv region, RDO Ukraine in the Cherkasy and Vinnitsa regions and Agrosem in the Khmelnitsky region.;Astarta–Kyiv,John Deere Ukraine,Horsch Maschinen GmbH,Pöttinger,Kinze Manufacturing,Monopil,Amity Technology,Agristar,Jupiter 9 Agroservice,RDO Ukraine,Agrosem;Ukraine;Realized Machinery Purchases,Tractors,>100 HP,Implements,Sprayers,Alliances,Service,Warranty,Precision Technology,Reporting,Planned Machinery Purchases

The agriculture and energy businesses grew while the machinery business operated at a high level. In 2019 BayWa's investment volume in Württemberg was around EUR 6.8 mn. With EUR 230 mn in sales, the agricultural business in the region remained at the 2018 level. In 2019 demand for fertilisers declined. The farmers prepare now for the heavier drought while the new fertiliser regulation is also making itself felt. There is an ongoing conversion from farms to organic farming. In the agriculture business, BayWa is investing around EUR 4.6 mn in Württemberg in 2019/2020. The new grain collection system was completed in Nellingen in 2019 with an investment of around EUR 1 mn. BayWa will build a new warehouse in Nürtingen with an investment of around EUR 2.8 mn. With EUR 123 mn the agricultural machinery business recorded a slight sales decline compared to 2018’s EUR 128 mn. BayWa is investing around EUR 4.4 mn in the machinery operations in Württemberg in 2019/2020. Around EUR 1.3 mn flowed already into the expansion of the Brackenheim site. BayWa Technik further expanded its range of machines and services there. A separate workshop building is now available for winegrowing customers. BayWa plans for investments of almost EUR 16 mn in 2020. In view of the current Coronavirus crisis, BayWa cannot assess how the 2020 financial year will continue. Although 80,000 seasonal workers from Eastern Europe are allowed to enter Germany until June 2020, farmers are still looking for workers since 300,000 helpers are actually needed. BayWa now supports farmers in their search by providing networking information and placement platforms on its website. (SONEAN: BayWa continues to drive automation and digitisation. Solutions from the Next Farming brand, created by BayWa subsidiary FarmFacts GmbH, play a relevant role. 25% of the agricultural land in Germany is already cultivated with Next Farming while around 19,000 farmers use the satellite-based applications. See the context for other insights and results of other BayWa subsidiaries, such as Franken, and Niederbayern. BayWa AG published its sustainability report for 2019. The German company succeeded in reducing relative energy consumption by roughly 22% in 2019. BayWa also moved one step closer to its goal of climate-neutral operations by 2030 by covering almost three-quarters of its electricity needs with renewable energies. That figure is set to rise to 100% by the end of 2020, https://bit.ly/3cywtac.;;"BayWa has again expanded its range of alternative mobility options. BayWa is building an LNG filling station in Freiberg am Neckar, and construction is planned for next winter. LNG causes less CO2 and less nitrogen oxide emissions than diesel.

The project, called ROMI, is currently under development at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia with the participation of the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology. Organic farmers spend about one-fifth of their time weeding, therefore the roving wheeled ROMI has one arm for weeding small vegetable farms to relieve such farmers of this task. According to the researchers, there is a huge need for this type of tool since the needs of small farmers have been largely ignored by manufacturers. To benefit such small farmers, ROMI's developers worked to keep its costs down by fitting it with off-the-shelf electric wheelchair motors and relying on open source hardware and software for AI and navigation. Once available, the robot should cost EUR 5,000 or less.;;;Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia,French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology;Spain,France;Precision Technology,Alliances

Rusagro, Cognitive Pilot Launch Ag Equipment Autonomy Project in Russia;;Intermediaries and customers;https://www.farm-equipment.com/articles/18376-rusagro-cognitive-pilot-launch-ag-equipment-autonomy-project-in-russia;2020-05-28;"Rusagro, https://www.rusagrogroup.ru/en/, Russia's largest agricultural holding company, and Cognitive Pilot, a joint venture between Sberbank and Cognitive Technologies, are introducing the Cognitive Agro Pilot, an autonomous driving system for agricultural machinery. The contract between the two companies states that the kit will be installed gradually on 242 combines of Rusagro in various regions during the harvesting campaigns of 2020-21, beginning in mid-June 2020. The autonomous system will control a combine’s unmanned movement, automatically identifying obstacles along the route and informing combine operators about obstacles or route failures. Operators will have access to trajectory tracking in real time. The project is said to represent the world’s largest project seeking one-time robotisation of farm equipment in four climate zones at once within one agricultural holding company. The partnership between Rusagro and Cognitive Pilot is carried out within the federal project “Digital Technologies” implemented by the Skolkovo Foundation. Rusagro is equipping its combine fleet with autonomous AI-based devices that is said to increase the efficiency of harvesting significantly, bringing the productivity to a new level with quality breakthrough. The Cognitive Agro Pilot system has already been successfully installed and tested in the USA, Brazil and China, as well as in several Russian regions. 
(SONEAN: Cognitive Pilot’s contract signed with Rusagro is worth RUB 130 mn, EUR 1.66 mn. Half of the project funding will come from the Skolkovo Foundation, which provided Rusagro a grant under a federal project. According to Cognitive Technologies, the system will allow to reduce the cost of grain by 3-5% and also lower losses during the harvesting process by up to two times, https://bit.ly/36wy4vr. Cognitive Agro Pilot is said to be an AI-based autonomous driving system that lets machinery operators focus on the quality of harvesting while leaving the robot assistant to run the machinery itself. Besides combines the system can be used also in tractors and sprayers and analyses images from just one video camera by using a convolutional neural network designed for agronomic purposes. See the context for more details of the new autonomous system, and what sets its apart from the ones generally used)";;The system understands the types and positions of objects facing the machinery, builds the correct trajectory of the combine and sends commands to perform manoeuvres. This sets Cognitive Agro Pilot apart from other solutions, which generally use a whole set of sensors in their models such as laser scanners and stereo cameras. Cognitive Agro Pilot ensures safe operations in harsh weather conditions such as those prevailing in Russia and works with any light intensity. The solution operates on territories with a weak satellite signal, which is often the case in Russia. The kit to be installed on combines in the Rusagro project includes an onboard computing unit, a video camera, a display, a set of connecting cables, and other elements of the control system.;Cognitive Pilot,Savings Bank of Russian Federation (Sberbank),Rusagro Group,Skolkovo Foundation;Brazil,China,Russia,United States;Alliances,Precision Technology,Product Launches,Harvesters,Grants,Subsidies

With the agreement Ekoniva will promote and implement the autonomous control system Cognitive Agro Pilot. Besides the installation and commissioning the agreement foresees the maintenance and engineering support to be carried out in 35 regions of Russia. EkoNiva will also provide consulting services related to the acquisition and maintenance of the system. Cognitive Pilot has already begun training EkoNiva engineers for the installation and commissioning. Soon, training will be provided for all technical specialists of EkoNiva's service departments in Russia as part of a three-year contract. It is expected that with this agreement up to 10,000 combines by various manufacturers will be equipped with the system. An important area of collaboration will be the creation of new solutions and products for smart farming using the C-Pilot unmanned control platform. According to Ekoniva this agreement is one of the most ambitious in the world as equipping its customers' equipment with autonomous systems will increase the efficiency of harvesting operations and reduce grain costs for them by 3-5%. According to Cognitive Pilot such a large-scale service work on servicing combines in such a large territory will allow the company to collect the world's most comprehensive video image database for training of neural systems. The cooperation will expand the sales network of Cognitive Pilot in Russia.;;EkoNiva Group, which is owned by German holding company Ekosem-Agrar, is composed of two entities.

JD has already started the follow-up project, GridCon2, in which a group of cable-guided and intelligently cooperating machines are used in a smart grid farm concept. The power level and the cable length are also increased as JD is also taking a completely new approach with three different parts: the implement, the drive unit (the tractor) and the energy supply unit. The drive unit, which is fully electric and works autonomously, has no primary energy source of its own but comes with a separate, multi-use energy supply unit. JD’s future vision assumes a “Smart Farm” that is energy and carbon neutral and has closed nutrient cycles. It is networked in the food production chain and uses autonomous machines. Such farms will not only produce food, but also energy. They will be able to provide network services with their energy production. Although this requires the development of new ways of cooperation with regional network operators and energy suppliers, it would simultaneously contribute to stable network structures while representing a new business area for farmers. This approach will come with various grid plug-in hybridisation concepts. JD is pursuing the idea of using the battery several times and around the clock. Multiple use of the battery will shorten its depreciation, making the investment lucrative. The replacement of fossil fuels by self-generated, sustainable energy would additionally increase the value added. JD is convinced that such a technology will be ready for the market, but the company does not know yet when.
(SONEAN: According to the source, JD also thinks that Fendt’s electric tractor with its compact size is not suitable for field work. In the first GridCon project one major task JD tackled was laying the cable on the ground next to the tractor and the implement without damaging it while driving in one direction and picking it up again when driving back. JD had to also install electric drives into the implements. See the context for other relevant insights)";;Since the control of such a cable machine could not be performed by a human operator, JD had to develop a complex control system including a robot arm for the cable routing, which resulted in the vehicle driving completely autonomously in the field. JD’s realisation for the electrification of implements in the GridCon project paved the way for its concept for a continuously variable electric-mechanical power split transmission with the option of for also driving electric implements. That concept won a gold medal at Agritechnica 2019. Both the old and the new GridCon projects are developed in collaboration with BAUM Consult GmbH and the University of Kaiserslautern (TU Kaiserslautern). The first GridCON project was based on the Sesam project in which the tractor was a fully battery powered electric tractor.;John Deere (Deere & Co.),BAUM Consult GmbH,Technische Universität Kaiserslautern,Fendt;Germany;Alternative Engines,Precision Technology,Strategy,Alliances

The restructuring will be finalised by the end of 2020, brining changes for growth in industrial spraying, which was strengthened with the acquisition of Intec in January 2020, and ramping up the development of advanced technologies with the Exxact Robotics brand. Although agricultural spraying accounts for 60% of sales of Exel, the company sees strong growth potential in garden spraying via Hozelock and Laser brands and industrial spraying via Sames-Kremlin and the Intec brands. To counter the overwhelming and negative public opinion regarding pesticides, Exel now advocates the philosophy “the right dose, at the right time, in the right place” for agricultural spraying. Unlike its full-liner and long-liner competitors, Exel is now positioning itself as the “spray-liner”, a global specialist in agricultural spraying with an extensive product line with cutting-edge solutions for environmentally friendly spraying. After the French government established a EUR 30 mn endowment fund to help farmers modernise their spraying equipment, Exel now aspires to support farmers in this upgrade. The agricultural spraying business will therefore operate with a new focus on accuracy and selectivity of applications. Since its French distributor network is only for spraying activities, excluding the sugar beet harvesting activities of Agrifac and Holmer, the company is making changes in marketing and sales structures, which will ensure the sales growth in Eastern Europe and CIS countries. Moreover, the company will also implement new ways of financing, including long-term rental and leasing, which will be an integral part of the marketing policy of Exel, which will remain a federation of independent companies. (SONEAN: Exel’s restructuring is aimed at overhauling the agricultural activities while adjusting the company’s structure in sugar beet harvesting. The new CEO, a manager outside of the founding family, at the end of 2019 was hired for this purpose. In November 2019 Exel established Exxact Robotics to develop new technologies with AI and vision tools. Currently Exxact Robotics is involved in vineyard solutions. Exel currently has more than 20 industrial sites around in France, UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Romania, United States and Australia while 80% of its sales are generated outside of France. See the context for more details of Exel’s current reorganisation, and the role of production sites);;The major reorganisation of agricultural spraying foresees the following changes: 1) Large-scale crops spraying will be done with Evrard, Berthoud, Matrot, Tecnoma, Hardi and Agrifac brands 2) Wide vineyards spraying with Nicolas and Berthoud 3) Narrow vineyards with Tecnoma and Berthoud 4) Arboriculture with Nicolas and Hardi 5) High-clearance tractors with Tecnoma and CMC.

The combine should be also JD’s “most comfortable combine” with the “most luxurious and quietest JD cab” that has logically designed harvest control systems on “intuitive” touch screen displays that can be customised. According to JD, the X9 is a “digital harvesting system” that is supported by mobile apps, a wireless data transfer and the Operations Centre. (SONEAN: JD also published in the USA a press release, using a more neutral language, providing details of the new combine. The new series comes with two models, the X9 1000 and X9 1100, both equipped with JD’s PowerTech 13.6 l engine and an updated ProDrive XL Transmission. Compared to JD’ S790 S Series combine, the model X9 1100 should use up to 20% less fuel per bushel harvested. The X Series combines are available on wheels or tracks. The train tank of the X9 1000 can hold up to 420 bushels and this figure is 460 bushels for the X9 1100. The X Series features a wide feeder house, dual separator and 75 ft2 Dyna-Flo XL cleaning shoe and comes with X Series Dual Separator having the largest threshing and separation areas JD has ever created. The X Series combines come with an integrated StarFire 6000 Receiver while JDLink with 5 year service as standard for both models. Three technology packages are available for the series: Select, Premium and Ultimate. The 3 comfort and convenience cab packages with the same names are also available for the series, https://bit.ly/2zFSDtA. See the context for a summary of what the Head of JD’s European Technology Innovation Center communicated on JD's technology strategy);;In an interview, the Head of JD’s European Technology Innovation Center (ETIC) in Kaiserslautern, Germany stated that it is important for JD to demonstrate how the future of agriculture looks like and how JD can contribute to this future. Innovation is one of the core values for future strategy. JD is therefore evolving into a Smart Industrial Company, which uses increasingly electrification, automation and AI in combinations, i.e. not separate from each other, for various developments. ETIC plays a special role within JD in those developments. ETIC has diverse workforce that is well connected to other JD units, especially to the Intelligent Solutions Group (ISG). Through publicly funded research projects ETIC works also with German and international associations on a wide range of future topics (https://bit.ly/3fuSJ6t).;John Deere (Deere & Co.);Germany,United Kingdom,United States;Product Launches,Harvesters,Strategy,Alternative Engines,Precision Technology
John Deere Introduces Entire New Header Lineup Including Drapers, Corn Heads and a Belt Pickup;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.deere.com/en/our-company/news-and-announcements/news-releases/2020/agriculture/2020jun15-drapers-corn-heads-belt-pickup/;2020-06-15;"Simultaneously with the official introduction of its new X Series combines in Europe and North America John Deere (JD) has updated its combine header lineup with the new HDR Rigid Cutterbar Drapers, RDF HydraFlex Drapers, CR and CF Corn Heads and a BP15 Belt Pickup. The new headers are compatible with the X Series as well as most S Series and T Series combines. HDR drapers are available in cutting widths from 35 to 50 ft and have a new hinged frame, which provides “unmatched terrain-following capability” with twice the wing range as a MacDon FD1 FlexDraper when harvesting on curves or uneven terrain. HDR drapers can be ordered with optional Grain Saver Draper Belts, which can reduce canola cutterbar loss up to 25%. RDF HydraFlex drapers are built on the cutting technology of the 700FD header and feature a new Two-Speed Center Feed Section that lets operators slow down the feed drum and center feed belt by 20% compared with the 700FD. These drapers come with a 4-inch HydraFlex Cutterbar whose knife system can make 1,980 cuts per minute. The CR Rigid Corn Heads feature a 19-inch cross auger and rolled auger and can be equipped with Active End Fenders that pull more stalks into the head. The CF Folding Corn Heads include all the features of the CR Rigid Corn Heads but feature a low-profile folding frame. There are 12-, 16- and 18-row CF Folding Corn Heads available for the X Series Combines and 12-row heads for S Series Combines. The CF Folding Corn Heads feature a fold cycle time of less than 60 seconds when connected to S700 combines and approximately 40 seconds with X9 combines. They have also 8-foot, 2-inch improvement in visibility over 700FC and 14-foot, 4-inch visibility improvement over Geringhoff’s Rota Disc.
(SONEAN: Each of the new drapers, corn heads and the belt pickup come with a header control unit HCU that communicates seamlessly with the combine. The HCU saves head-specific factory calibration settings and collects and sends header-width information to the combine for accurate yield mapping. See the context for the features of the BP15 Belt Pickup)";;The BP15 Belt Pickup features improved feed rate adjustability to handle large or bulky crops with a standard two-speed auger drive sprocket that delivers a 20% faster feed rate that’s ideal for harvesting canola. A slower speed feed rate can be used for less bulky crops like cereals and grass seed. A factory-installed crop shield minimizes grain loss by ensuring more crop goes through the feederhouse, preventing it from building up and laying on the feederhouse. JD also unveiled a new material collection system called “Dump-From-Seat” for its Z900 ZTrak zero-turn mowers (https://bit.ly/3e6ybkB).;John Deere (Deere & Co.),MacDon Industries Ltd,Carl Geringhoff GmbH & Co.

Focused on Unlocking Customer Value, Deere Announces New Operating Model;;Competitors and Suppliers;https://www.deere.com/en/our-company/news-and-announcements/news-releases/2020/corporate/2020jun17-new-operating-model/;2020-06-17;"Deere & Company (DE) announced a new vision and operating model to accelerate the integration of smart technology with manufacturing. The new industrial strategy is designed to unlock new value for customers and to help them become more profitable and sustainable through the rapid introduction of new technologies. Actions will be concentrated on the following three focus areas. A strategic alignment of products and solutions around “Production Systems” roadmaps to drive an integrated product roadmap and related investments. Investments in technology and R&D to deliver solutions through a “Technology Stack” made up of hardware, embedded software, connectivity, data platforms, and applications. The integration of aftermarket and support capabilities to effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of products with specific “Lifecycle Solutions”. Along with the new strategy, Deere also announced new organization and personnel assignments. Cory J. Reed has been appointed to the new role of President, Worldwide Agriculture & Turf Division for Production & Precision Agriculture Equipment and for Americas and Australia. Markwart von Pentz has been appointed President, Worldwide Agriculture & Turf Division for Small Ag & Turf for Europe, CIS, Asia and Africa. Jahmy J. Hindman has been named the CTO. Marc A. Howze, current as Chief Administrative Officer, will also assume new responsibilities as Group President, Lifecycle Solutions. John H. Stone will assume his new role as President, Worldwide Construction & Forestry and Power Systems. Deere will also adopt a more disciplined approach to capital allocation by devoting investments to the most promising and profitable opportunities. Deere plans to dramatically accelerate the speed of technological innovations.
(SONEAN: the new strategy may be related to John May, who was appointed as the new CEO only in 2019. Just recently, Deere has appointed a Verizon executive vice president and group CEO, Tamra Erwin, to its board of directors to provide leadership in smart connected machines and precision technologies. See the context for his May`s background and more information of Erwin)";;May, a “Tech Guy”, was previously the COO of the company and also the driving force in the acquisition of Blue River Technology. May pushed also forward a deal to purchase Precision Planting whose acquisition failed after the U.S. Justice Department objected the takeover on antitrust grounds. A proponent of the exploitation of IoT and connectivity in agriculture he was also assumed to make the company “more efficient and profitable” without suffering on the innovation side at the time of his appointment (https://bit.ly/3efV5WD). At Verizon, Erwin furthermore was notable for her strategic impact, marketing and operations focus and technical knowledge, especially in digital transformation, innovation, and 5G technology (https://bit.ly/2zGMBJ2).;Deere & Company,Verizon Communications Inc.;United States;Strategy,Human Resources,Precision Technology,Digitalization
